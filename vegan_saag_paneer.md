Vegan Saag Paneer

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 small onions, chopped
* 2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 18 ounces fresh spinach (or chopped frozen spinach- skip to step 2)
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 14 ounce package extra firm tofu, drained and pressed at least 20 minutes, and cut into 1 inch cubes
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 cup vegetable broth
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 teaspoon ground cumin
* 2 teaspoon garam masala
* 2 teaspoon chili paste (sambal oelek or 1/2 tsp chili powder)
* 3 teaspoons granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup full fat coconut milk from a can, or more, if you like

**PREPARATION**

1. Place onion, ginger, garlic and spinach in food processor. Pulse, until the spinach is very finely chopped, stopping to stir up everything a few times.
2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add tofu. Cook about 10 minutes, until tofu cubes begin to brown lightly and crisp up, tossing a few times to ensure even cooking on all sides.
3. Sprinkle turmeric over tofu and toss a few more times to coat the tofu cubes.
4. Add spinach mixture, broth, lemon juice, cumin, garam masala, chili paste, sugar and salt. Stir a few times to mix everything up. Reduce heat to medium and allow to simmer about 10 minutes, until most of the liquid has cooked off.
5. Add coconut milk, and cook another minute. Mixture should be thick and creamy.
