## LEMON CURD

**INGREDIENTS:** 
* 3 tbsp lemon zest
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 2 large whole eggs
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp corn starch (optional)
 
**PREPARATION:**

1. Cream butter at medium speed in the bowl of an electric mixer. Slowly add sugar and lemon zest to butter and keep creaming at medium speed for a few minutes, until mixture is light in color and fluffy.
2. Add eggs, one at a time, waiting until egg has been completely incorporated before adding the next one.
3. Add salt. And finally, add lemon juice, and stir on low speed.
4. Pour mixture in a small sauce pan and bring it to a low boil over medium heat, while stirring nonstop. (this is where you could add the corn starch.)
5. Continue heating until the curd reaches 170 F for pasteurization.
6. Immediately take it off the heat and pour into a heat proof bowl.
7. Let the curd cool in the fridge to thicken.
