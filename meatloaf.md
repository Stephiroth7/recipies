## JUDY'S MEATLOAF

**INGREDIENTS**

* 3 lbs ground chuck
* 1 c. fresh breadcrumbs
* 2.5 tsp season salt (to taste)
* 2.5 tsp garlic powder (to taste)
* 2.5 tsp black pepper (to taste)
* 1/2 small onion or one shallot
* 2 medium carrots
* handful of flat (Italian) parseley
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 c. ketchup


**PREPARATION**

1. use a food processor to grind up the onion and carrots with the parseley.
2. In a large bowl, add breadcrumbs and seasoning to ground beef.
3. Add the carrots, eggs, and ketchup to the meat.  
4. Stir until combined, but do not overmix.  The mixture will be loose.
5. Bake on a rack covered by a piece of tin foil, at 400 for at least 60 minutes (or until internal temp is 160).  
6. The last 20 minutes of baking, brush with more ketchup and tent with foil (if getting too dark, otherwise leave open).

#### NOTES:
* can substitute dried flaked potato (mashed potato mix) instead of breadcrumbs, but it will be more dense.
