## Banana Bread

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 egg
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 tbsp buttermilk (or greek yogurt)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 very ripe medium-large mashed bananas

**PREPARATION:**

Preheat the oven to 350F, and have an oiled + floured loaf pan ready. 

1. Mix the dry ingredients together.  
2. Mix the wet ingredients together in a medium bowl until homogenous.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients all at once.
4. Mix the wet & dry ingredients together until combined- it will only be about 25-30 strokes of a spatula.  It's ok if the walnuts are a little floury still; this helps prevent them from sinking to the bottom during baking.
5. Bake at 350F on the middle rack of the oven for 45 - 60 minutes.  To test for doneness, insert a knife into the center of the loaf; if the knife comes out with batter still on it, let the bread cook longer.  
6. Remove to a wire rack to cool.  

NOTES:
* Can also use an 8"x8" square or 8" round cake pan- remember to only fill the container 2/3 full, because this recipe rises a lot.
