## MACARONS

**INGREDIENTS:** 

* 1 cup almond flour
* 3/4 cup confectioners sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 3 egg whites from large eggs
* 1 tbsp powdered cocoa (optional, for chocolate shells)
 
**PREPARATION:**

* preheat oven to 350 F.  Have two parchment-lined baking sheets ready, as well as a piping bag with large round tip.

1. Sift together the almond flour and confectioners sugar.
2. Mix whites and sugar together in a bowl or in a double boiler pan. The water should not be boiling, only simmering.
3. Whisk the whites and sugar together until the sugar is completely dissolved.
4. Remove from heat and start whipping the mixture at high speed until stiff peaks form.  This could take from 3 - 5 minutes.
5. As soon as the eggs reach stiff peaks, stopp whipping.  
6. Add the almond and sugar mixture in three parts, scooping with a "J" motion to incorporate and push air out of the mixture.
(This step is called macaronage, and is where you could add 1-2 drops of food coloring as well.)
7. The mixture should be the consistency where if you pick up a spatula-full and pour it down into the bowl, it is able to make a figure-8 shape without breaking.
(The batter should be falling off the spatula in a ribbon, without breaking up.  Also, a spoonfull of batter on a baking sheet should smooth out, not leave a distinct peak.)
8. As soon as this stage is reached, STOP FOLDING.
9. Put the batter into the piping bag and pipe into the baking sheet.  Try to make the rounds consistent.
10. Let the rounds dry on a countertop for 20 - 60 minutes, until a skin has formed on the top.
11. Place the macarons into the oven and bake for 9 minutes with the door shut.  They will puff up from the bottom, but should not break open or be hollow.
12. Wait for the macarons to cool, then fill with your preferred filling.

#### NOTES:
* if using curd for filling, also make some similar-flavored buttercream.  First make a moat of buttercream at the shell's edge, then fill inside with curd before sandwiching.
* stiff, drier fillings work best.  Nut butters, buttercream, etc.  Most fruit preserves will smear, but could possibly be made thicker by cooking down further or adding pectin before filling.
