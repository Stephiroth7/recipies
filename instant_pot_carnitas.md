## CARNITAS (Whole30, Instant Pot)

**INGREDIENTS**

* 2.5 to 3 lbs pork shoulder or butt, cut into large cubes
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 6 to 8 cloves garlic
* 3/4 cup fresh orange juice
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 2 tsp oregano
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp chipotle powder
* small handful cilantro, chopped
* 1 tbsp ghee or cooking oil


**PREPARATION**

1. Put the meat, onion, garlic, spices, and lime juice into a bowl and let marinate at least 2 hours or overnight.
2. In the Instant Pot, add the orange juice and all the contents of the marinating bowl.
3. Set the Instant Pot to "Pressure Cook" for 20 minutes and let the steam vent naturally when finished.  
4. Before taking the lid off the Instant Pot, Preheat the broiler.  
5. When done, pull out the meat and shred it slightly.
6. Place the shredded meat on an oven-safe tray and place under the broiler until crisp, 5 - 7 minutes.
7. When the meat is crispy on top, remove from heat and add the cilantro as garnish.

#### NOTES:
* can leave the lime or orange in the Instant Pot to cook as well.
* season again (to taste) once the meat is out of the Instant Pot but before broiling.
