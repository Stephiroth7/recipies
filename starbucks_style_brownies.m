# Brownies

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
* 3 cup granulated sugar
* 6 eggs
* 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 cup unsweetened natural cocoa powder
* 3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
* 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chunks, divided equally

**PREPARATION:**

Preheat oven to 350F and spray a half sheet (18" x 13") baking pan with cooking spray.

1. Add the butter to a large, microwave safe bowl and heat on high power to melt, about 1 minute.
2. Add the sugar, eggs, vanilla, and whisk to combine.
3. Add the cocoa powder and stir to combine 
4. Add the flour, salt, and stir to combine.
5. Add half chocolate chunks and stir to combine.
6. Turn batter out into prepared pan (it will be thick) and smooth the top lightly with a spatula.
7. Evenly sprinkle remaining chocolate chunks on top, lightly pushing them down so they adhere.
8. Bake for about 30 - 35 minutes or until the edges are set and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, but no batter. 


NOTES:
* use the baking spray with flour added, or add flour after spraying to help them release.
* If th cocoa powder is particularly lumpy, sift it to get the lumps out.  The cocoa powder may remain as dry lumps otherwise.
* Allow brownies to cool in pan on a wire rack for about 2 hours before slicing and serving.
