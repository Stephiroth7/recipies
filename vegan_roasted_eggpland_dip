## ROASTED EGGPLANT DIP

**INGREDIENTS**
* 1 medium eggplant, diced
* 2 red bell peppers
* 1 red onion
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1 tsp dried thyme (or 1 TBSP fresh)
* 1 TBSP tomato paste (or tomato sauce to taste)
* 1 TBSP red wine vinegar
* 2-3 TBSP olive oil
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt (smoked salt)
* hot cayenne pepper (to taste)

**PREPARATION**

1. On a sheet pan on top of a roasting/cookie rack, roast the eggplant, bell peppers, red onion, and garlic until brown spots appear and vegetables are soft.
2. Let the vegetables cool off a little bit, add the thyme, tomato paste, and olive oil, and place everything in a food processor.  Blend until the desired consistency is reached; chunks or smooth is completely by preference.
3. Scoop out the food processor contents into a small bowl.  Add the remaining ingredients, adjusting to taste.
