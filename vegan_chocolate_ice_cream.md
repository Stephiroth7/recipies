ADAPTED FROM https://www.seriouseats.com/vegan-chocolate-ice-cream

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 CAN COCONUT CREAM (not the same as Cream Of Coconut)
* 1 CAN COCONUT MILK
* 3/4 CUP RAW OR BROWN SUGAR
* 1/4 CUP + 2 TBSP DUTCH PROCESS COCOA POWDER
* 1/4 CUP LIGHT CORN SYRUP
* 1/2 CUP COCOA NIBS (optional)
* 1/2 BAR (2oz) 70%-80% DARK CHOCOLATE (in pieces)
* 3/4 TO 1 TSP SALT
* 1 TBSP BOURBON, WHISKEY, OR OTHER LIQUER 


**PREPARATION**

1. In a medium saucepan whisk together cocoa powder and sugar until well combined, then slowly add coconut milk, whisking constantly, until a thick, lump-free paste forms.
2. Whisk in remaining coconut milk and add coconut cream and corn syrup, then cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a simmer. 
3. Add chocolate bar pieces and stir until melted. 
4. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla extract and whiskey, then add salt to taste.
5. Immersion blend the mixture for 30 seconds to ensure emulsification. (Or transfer to a real blender, but immersion blender is easier.)
  5.1. Stir in cocoa nibs (or add cocoa nibs in a strainer bag) to the base.
6. Pour mixture into an airtight container, cover and chill in refrigerator overnight, or until it is very cold (at least 45°F/7°C).
  6.1. (optional) strain out cocoa nibs or remove strainer bag from liquid base
8. Pour into popsicle molds, or Churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. 
  8.1. Transfer churned ice cream to an airtight container and chill in freezer until ice cream is firm enough to scoop, about 5 hours.

## NOTES
* Cream of Coconut and Coconut Cream are different things; Cream of Coconut is already sweetened and thickened for use in things like cocktails. Coconut Cream is unsweetened and is just the thickest part of coconut milk.
* Dutch Process vs Natural Cocoa powder will result in slightly different flavors- a natural one will be more tart, while a dutch process will be more chocolatey.
  * Natural cocoa powder will work just fine since it's easier to find, but a blend of the two or 100% dutch process would be better.
  * Dutch Process means the cocoa was alkalized to reduce its natural acidity, giving it a less bitter taste and darker colour.
* Cocoa Nibs are not necessary but do impart more depth of flavor, so let them simmer and sit in the base as long as possible.
  * It's not necessary to strain out the cocoa nibs if you don't mind slightly chunky bits in the ice cream.
