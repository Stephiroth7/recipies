## STUFFED MUSHROOMS

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 lbs ground pork (or beef)
* 20 to 30 large mushrooms, stems and gills removed.  
* (optional) save the mushroom stems and very finely chop them.
* 1/2 small onion, finely chopped
* 1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 cup riced cauliflower (optional)
* 1/2 cup minced butternut squash (optional)
* 1/2 cup chopped spinach, drained of liquid
* 1/2 cup almond flour
* 1 tsp salt (or more to taste)
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp fennel seeds



**PREPARATION**

Preheat the oven to 350.  Have a parchment-lined baking sheet ready.

1. In a large saute pan over medium heat, cook the pork fro 7 to 10 minutes until it is mostly cooked but some pink remains.  Break it apart into tiny pieces as it cooks.
2. Push the meat away from the heat and add the onion, garlic, mushroom stems, cauliflower, squash, and spinach to the saute pan.  Cook for another 5 minutes to 6 minutes, mixing well.
3. REmove from heat.  Add the almond flour and stir to combine.   
4. Add the red pepper, and season with the salt and pepper to taste.  (The mixture will be dense.)
5. Fill each mushroom cap with a generous amount of the mixture and place on the sheet pan.
6. Bake for 30 - 35 minutes until the stuffing is browned and crusty.

#### NOTES:
* this will make about 4 cups of filling.  This same mixture can be used to stuff bell peppers after adding some tomato paste.
* Stuffed mushrooms can be cooked and frozen for later.
