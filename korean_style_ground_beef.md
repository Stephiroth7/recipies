# Korean Style Ground Beef

**INGREDIENTS**

* 1 pound lean ground beef (93% lean)
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
* 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
* 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons cup light brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon corn starch
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 6 green onions, chopped, divided


**PREPARATION:**

In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, corn starch, and red pepper flakes. Stir until sugar is dissolved.

1. In a large skillet, heat the sesame oil.  Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
2. Add the ground beef and cook for about 5 more minutes, breaking apart large clumps.
3. Add the soy sauce mixture to the pan.
4. Continue to simmer until the beef is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.
5. Add half the green onions and stir to distribute.

NOTES:

* microwave or otherwise gently heat the soy sauce mixture to melt the sugar and begin to thicken the corn starch.
* garnish with the remaining green onions
* can be served with other sides; any remaining vegetables in the house can be sauteed and served with the meat and rice.
