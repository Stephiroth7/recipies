#Slow-Cooked Kale and Ham Hocks

Prep time:  20 mins Cook time:  6 hours 
Total time:  6 hours 20 mins
Serves: 6-8
 
*INGREDIENTS:* 
1 meaty smoked ham hock, or 4 or 5 ham hock slices (about 8 ounces)
1½ cups water
1 cup chicken broth, low sodium or homemade
12 cups torn kale leaves, tough ribs and stems discarded (2 inch pieces)
2 tablespoons bacon grease, vegetable oil, or olive oil
1 onion thinly sliced
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, plus more to serve
Salt and pepper
Hot sauce for serving


*PREPARATION:*
1. Put the ham hock in a microwavable bowl and cover with the water and chicken broth. Cover and microwave on high for 3 minutes, or until bubbly.
2. Spray the inside of the slow cooker with cooking spray, then add the greens to the slow cooker.
3. Heat a large pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat and add the bacon drippings. Add the onion and saute until translucent and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onions to the slow cooker. Then pour in the ham hock mixture and stir.
4. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, until your greens are nice and tender.
5. Remove the ham hock from the slow cooker and shred the lean meat. Return the meat to the pot, discarding the skin and bones. Add the cayenne, cider vinegar, salt, and pepper, then stir. Set the cooker to warm and serve straight from the pot alongside a bottle of your favorite hot sauce and extra vinegar.


####NOTE:
**Worked great with chinese sausage (lap chong) will probably work with italian sausage as well.
