## ZUCCHINI BREAD

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 2 cups all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon fine salt
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1‚ÅÑ2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 3 eggs
* 2 cups sugar
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* 8 ounces softened cream cheese
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups shredded zucchini
* 2 cups chopped walnuts



**PREPARATION**

1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease TWO 9x5x3 loaf pans and dust lightly with some flour.  (Or use cake release)
2. Mix the flour, baking soda, baking powder,salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg together so it's completely homogenous.
3. Add a tablespoon or two of the flour mix to the walnuts in a bowl and stir to coat them. (This will help prevent them from sinking down as the bread cooks.)
4. Mix the eggs, sugar, vegetable oil and vanilla until combined.  Beat in the cream cheese.
5. Add the flour mixture to the liquid mixture and stir until just combined.
6. Fold the chopped walnuts and shredded zucchini into the mix and pour the batter into the loaf pans.
7. Bake for 50-65 minutes in the center rack of the oven until a knife comes out clean.  

#### NOTES
* makes 2 LARGE loaves or 7 small loaves
* Sometimes I check it at 45 minutes and put some tin foil over the top to prevent burning.  
* You can also add up to another half cup of nuts or dried fruit.
