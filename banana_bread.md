## BANANA WALNUT BREAD

**INGREDIENTS** 

* 2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 egg
* 1 cup sugar
* 1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 tablespoons buttermilk or yogurt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 ripe medium-large bananas, mashed
* 1⁄2 cup chopped walnuts



**PREPARATION**

1. Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9x5x3 loaf pan and dust lightly with some flour.  (Or use cake release)
2. Mix the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together so it's completely homogenous.
3. Add a tablespoon or two of the flour mix to the walnuts and stir to coat them. (This will help prevent them from sinking down as the bread cooks.)
4. Mix the bananas, egg, sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla, and milk until combined.
5. Add the flour mixture to the liquid mixture and stir until just combined.
6. Fold the chopped walnuts into the mix and pour the batter into the loaf pan.
7. Bake for 50-65 minutes in the center rack of the oven until a knife comes out clean.  

#### NOTES
* Sometimes I check it at 45 minutes and put some tin foil over the top to prevent burning.  
* You can also add up to another half cup of nuts or dried fruit.

* to make CHOCOLATE: substitute 1⁄4 cup cocoa powder in the flour and add 1 TBSP more sugar, optional additional 1⁄2 cup chocolate chips.
