Tikka Masala Sauce

*INGREDIENTS*

2 tablespoons of coconut oil
2 small onions (or 1 large onion) finely diced
1 1/2 tablespoons garlic finely grated
1 tablespoon ginger finely grated

1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon paprika (optional for colour and flavour)
1/2 teaspoon ground red chili powder (adjust to your taste preference)
1 teaspoon salt

14 oz (400g) tomato puree or crushed tomatoes (tomato sauce/Passata)
1 1/4 cups of coconut milk
1 1/2 teaspoon brown or white sugar

4 tablespoons fresh cilantro or coriander to garnish

*PREPARATION*

1. Melt the coconut oil in a wide, shallow saute pan. 
2. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 
3. Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add spices. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.
4. Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. 
5. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.
6. Stir the coconut milk and sugar through the sauce. It will thicken as it cools.

* If desired, use a hand blender to blend until smooth.
* This can be made with more protein, by adding either drained chickpeas or fried tofu to the simmer sauce.  If choosing tofu, fry the tofu separately for better texture and flavor.
