# Filled Kolaczki Cookies

* Makes app'x. 36-42 Cookies
* Requires chilling dough min 2 hours

**INGREDIENTS - DOUGH** 
* 2 ¼ cups all purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 8 oz cream cheese
* 1 cup unsalted butter softened
* ½ cup granulated sugar for rolling

**INGREDIENTS - FILLING** 
* various fillings - store bought jams and pastry fillings are fine, but pie filling will likely be too loose.

Homemade:
* Fruit - 150g frozen high-pectin fruit, 100g sugar, juice of ½ lemon, 1/4 tsp corn starch, simmer on low heat until thick, blend if necessary
* Nut - ¼ lb finely ground/chopped nuts, 1 tbsp melted butter, ½ c sugar, ¼ c hot milk, let sit 10 mins until thick.


**PREPARATION**

Preheat oven to 375F 
Cover half sheet baking pan in parchment paper 

* Whisk flour and salt together in a medium bowl and set aside.
* Beat the cream cheese and butter together with a mixer until completely incorporated and creamy (3-5 minutes).
* Reduce the speed of the mixer and *slowly* add in the flour. The dough will be soft but not sticky.
* Divide the dough into 4 equal parts and flatten each to ¾” thick. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until hard, at least 2 hours.
* Take one of the disks of dough from the refrigerator and lightly flour both sides. 
* Spread granulated sugar on your pastry board or work surface.
* Place the dough on top and roll out pastry 1/8” to 1/16” thick. (Thinner is better)
* Cut as many 3 inch squares or rounds a possible, saving the scraps for later reuse.
* Gently move the unfilled dough to a parchment covered baking sheet.
* Place ½ to ¾ teaspoon of filling into the center of each square in a line.
* Gently grab two opposite corners and fold one over the other, lightly pressing down to try and seal them together. (Water may help seal them.)
* Rearrange cookies so that they are no closer than 1" apart on the baking sheet.
* Bake 12-14 minutes or until the bottom edges are a golden, let cool slightly, and then move to a wire rack to cool.
* (Optional) Dust with powdered sugar after baking and cooling

NOTES:
* Don’t chill the assembled cookies prior to baking them. This re-solidifies the butter in the dough and will cause them to puff too much and open the cookies!
* Pressing the dough down slightly in the center and along the folds will help keep them from popping open during baking.
 * Making them larger will also help prevent popping open


STORAGE:
* Unbaked, unassembled cookies can be stored in the freezer and brought to room temperature before assembly & baking.
* Baked & cooled cookies store at room temperature layered between sheets of wax paper and then wrapped loosely in foil. Freeze for up to three months.
