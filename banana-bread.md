INGREDIENTS 
* 2 cups flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1⁄4 teaspoon salt
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 egg
* 1 cup sugar
* 1⁄2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 tablespoons buttermilk or yogurt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 ripe medium-large bananas, mashed
* 1⁄2 cup chopped walnuts



DIRECTIONS
1 Preheat oven to 350. Grease a 9x5x3 loaf pan and dust lightly with some flour.  (Or use cake release)
2 Blend the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon together so it's completely mixed.
3 Add a tablespoon or two of flour mix to the walnuts and stir to coat them. (This will help prevent them from sinking down as the bread cooks.)
4 Mix the egg, sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla, and milk until combined.
5 Add the flour mixture to the liquid mixture and stir until just combined.
6 Fold the chopped walnuts into the mix and pour the batter into the loaf pan.
7 Bake for 50-60 minutes in the center rack of the oven until a knife comes out clean.  

Sometimes I check it at 45 minutes and put some tin foil over the top to prevent burning.  You can also add up to another half cup of nuts or dried fruit.
