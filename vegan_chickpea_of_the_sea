## CHICKPEA OF THE SEA
(vegan chickpea salad)

**INGREDIENTS**
1 can (14 oz) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed. (Reserve the aquafaba liquid for any later baking)
juice of 1/2 lemon + some zest OR 1 TSP vinegar-based hot sauce
1/4 â€“ 1/3 cup of vegan mayo 
1/2 cup celery (about 2 small stalks, leaves ok too), chopped
1/2 cup red onion (about 1/2 small), chopped
1/2 TSP garlic powder
1/2 TSP onion powder
1 TBSP finely chopped nori (optional)
himalayan salt & cracked pepper to taste

**PREPARATION**

Put the chickpeas in a medium bowl and smash with a fork until about 3/4 of them are smashed.  Some are left whole for texture.  It's ok if the skins come off the beans.
Mix all the remaining ingredients into the bowl.  
Stir together until combined.
