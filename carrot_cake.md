## CARROT CAKE

**INGREDIENTS**

* 4 eggs
* 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil
* 2 cups white sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon OR pumpkin pie spice mix. (a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove.)
* 3 cups grated carrots
* 1 cup chopped pecans (or any other chopped nut)


**PREPARATION**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan or 2 8" rounds.

2. Toss the nuts into 2 tbsp of the flour and mix to coat the nuts.  This is to prevent the nuts from sinking to the bottom of the cake.

3. In a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, white sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into prepared pan so that the pans are 2/3 full.

4. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.

**NOTES**
* I sometimes use less sugar, just 1.5 cups.
