INGREDIENTS:

1/2 cup unsalted butter
4 onions, sliced
2 garlic cloves, chopped
2 bay leaves
2 fresh thyme sprigs 
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup red wine
1 heaping tablespoons corn starch
1.5 quarts beef broth (1/2 cup reserved)
1 baguette, sliced (optional)
1/2 pound grated Gruyere (optional)

PREPARATION:
1. Melt the stick of butter in a large pot over medium heat. 
2. Add the onions, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, and salt and pepper and cook until the onions are very soft and caramelized, about 25 minutes. 
3. Add the wine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has evaporated and the onions are dry, about 5 minutes. 
4. Discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. 
5. Whisk the reserved beef broth with the corn starch, and add to the onion mixture. 
6. Turn the heat down to medium low and cook for 10 minutes, stirring gently. 
7. Add the rest of the beef broth, bring the soup back to a simmer, and cook for 10-20 more minutes. 
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
