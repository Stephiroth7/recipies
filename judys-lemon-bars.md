## JUDY'S LEMON BARS

**INGREDIENTS** 

CRUST

* 2 Cups Flour
* 1/2 Cup Sugar
* Pinch of salt
* 3/4 Cup Cold Butter
* 1 tsp cold water
* 1/2 cup chopped almonds or almond flour

LEMON LAYER

* 4 Eggs
* 2 Cups Sugar
* 2 Tbls Flour
* 1/2 Tsp baking powder
* Grated rind of two large lemons 
* 1/4 cup (or more) lemon juice up to 1/2 cup

**PREPARATION** 

1. Sift flour, sugar and salt together; add nuts.  
2. Incorporate butter with pastry blender or just work it in with your hands until the dough is crumbly. 
(lazy way: use food processor to incorporate it all)
3. Press into the bottom of a 9x12 pan. 
4. Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes until the edges are barely golden. 
5. Make the lemon layer while the crust is baking.
6. Beat lemon layer ingredients and pour over hot crust.  
7. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. (Edges will be golden.)

#### NOTES:
* spray the pan with baking spray and line the bottom with parchment.
* try to make the crust come up the edges a little bit- it's easier to reserve a litttle bit of the dough, so that you can build up edges after it's been pressed in.
* if you bake longer than 25 minutes, the top might get brown.  The filling may pull away from the crust edges as well.
