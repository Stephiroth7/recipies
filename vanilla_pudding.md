## VANILLA PUDDING

**INGREDIENTS**
* 2/3 cup white sugar
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 2 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk (divided)
* 4 large egg yolks
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**PREPARATION**
1. In a small saucepan, whisk together the sugar and salt.
2. In a small dish, combine the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of the almond milk, mixing until dissolved.
3. Add the cornstarch mixture, remaining almond milk, and egg yolks to the saucepan, whisking until combined.
4. Cook the pudding over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and bubbles just begin to form on the surface.
5. Whisking constantly, turn down the heat to low and cook for about 1 minute more.
6. Stir in the vanilla extract.
7. Place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming while the pudding cools and thickens. 
8. Refrigerate.
